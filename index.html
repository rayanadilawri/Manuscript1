            <p> It’s no longer a question of whether art institutions should have a virtual presence.
            Rather, the onus is being placed on designers to facilitate meaningful interactions with art that might occur in the gallery, via Web-based applications or in new hybrid spaces that merge the real and the virtual.
            Any attempt to augment an encounter with artwork using technological means invariably raises questions about the values we assign to certain modes of viewing.
            After all, isn’t visiting a museum inherently tied to a very deep, very primary real-life experience? The promises and pitfalls of new technologies are forcing museums to 
            rebalance their traditional mandates to care for a collection of physical objects while enabling scholarship and providing the wider public an opportunity to engage with works of art. —R.G. and S.H.</p>
