Hello! My name is Rayana Dilawri
Welcome to my first HTML / CSS project of my Masters course in product design at Parsons 
On this microsite, I have used the text from the article "The Museum Interface" which you can find here: https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/the-museum-interface-63033/
I redesigned it, in accordance to my thoughts on the article and also to represent the content being shared. 
My design is aimed to illustrate the interview format and different opinions, experiences and backgroudns of the two authors, Rob Giampietro and Sarah Hromack
If you have any questions, feedback or thoughts please feel free to reach out to dilar840@newschool.edu
